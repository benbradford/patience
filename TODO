bug: undo deck turn anim not in correct place
    - although looks quite nice! make all deck turns start from slightly above itself to give turn illusion

    
Move everything that isn't react from View to ModelView and rename extension to .ts
undo and deckClick states

polish: consider making card turn animation seperate - turn cards in hold pile whilst moving

allow queues of animations

auto-complete
animate pickup?
change shadow to style so can animate shadow
winning sequence
