When dragging or animating, make cards below main card follow based on the same offset as at the start
Cancelling anim - need to store old position

CardBox - make scalable - fixed width and height? makes no sense

Take a look at what more could go into Cards/



make SolitaireViewModel have an interface only for the view 
    - maybe rename it ViewInterface
    - move other stuff into a new class

allow different cards and backs and table

create toolbar with undo, quit, retry, solve?

auto-complete

winning sequence

back-end...


Move Cards into its own folder with
    /Cards
        /Model
        /View 
        /ViewModel
deploy to something npm can install

make another card game using npm install cards
