Refactor:
    State Machine
    Ticker
    FloatingCard - CardProxy along with an interface for position and scale
    FloatingCards
    FloatingCardViews - renders FloatingCardView for each FloatingCard in FloatingCards
    Anim removed from view and AnimView goes
    Anims use a FloatingCard
    Dragging uses a FloatingCard
    Move everything that isn't react from View to ModelView and rename extension to .ts
    Use CardBox instead of ReactBox


polish: consider making card turn animation seperate

allow queues of animations

auto-complete
animate pickup?
change shadow to style so can animate shadow
winning sequence
